# UFOs

## Overview
Dana has requested that I recreate a dynamic website on UFO sightings using HTML, CSS and Javascript.  

## Results

Intially the website was only designed to look in the data.js for dates.  But I have updated the app.js to include the date, city, state, country and shape of the UFO to filter throught the data.js.

## Summary

One drawback for this website is the data.js will have to be continually updated.  Dana may want to research to learn if the is an API service that might have that information so the website would be updated automatically.
